# Face-Recognition
Python Face Matching Program: Identify and Match Faces

This program takes two images as input: one image containing the target face (for identification) and a second image where potential matches are searched for. Using face recognition techniques, the program analyzes the faces in both images and checks if the face in the first image is present in the second. If a match is found, the program will display the result indicating that a face match was detected. It uses OpenCV, face_recognition, PIL and tkinter library to perform face detection and comparison, ensuring an efficient and reliable face-matching process. 
This program runs within a gui which improves the user experience.
